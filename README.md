# AutoGPC
An automatic Gaussian process classifier.

## What is AutoGPC?
AutoGPC is a package for automatic construction and natural-language description
of (binary) classification models based on Gaussian processes. It is an extension
to the [Automatic Statistician](http://www.automaticstatistician.com/index/)
which aims to automate data science.

This package constitutes a large part of the author's M.Eng. dissertation at
the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) of
[University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). It is a work-in-progress.
